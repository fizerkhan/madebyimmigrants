#Made by Immigrants

A showcase of amazing businesses and projects proudly made by first and second generation immigrants.

#Why?
I'm the son of immigrants, I have many friends who are immigrants or children of immigrants. I've seen my grandparents become citizens of the United States. Immigrants have created and built this country, and I wanted to showcase the amazing businesses and projects started by immigrants and their children. Immigrants create jobs.

In response to President Trump's [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states) restricting green card holders and immigrants from entering the United States, I wanted to do something to positively impact the situation. I donated to the ACLU, but I wanted to do something more, even if it's just a tiny project that shows how immigrants have made America great.

#Contributing
Please submit an issue or Pull request using the template! I would love to have as many projects and companies as possible. If you can, please make a statement publicly supporting those who are affected by President Trump's Executive Order.

#It's all tech startups and businesses...
I can recognize when I live in a bubble, and these were the companies that stuck out to me. I want this to be more than just tech startups or businesses. If you know of other companies, projects, artists, or anyone who would want to be featured on this site, **please submit an issue or pull request!**. It would be great to have examples showcasing all walks of life.
